# CLINICALC Mobile App

This is the **mobile app version** of CLINICALC, built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) and React Native.

CLINICALC is an open-source modern application designed to streamline and simplify nursing informatics calculations. By entering patient data, nurses and healthcare professionals can instantly access accurate, actionable insights for medication dosing, fluid management, lab interpretation, and more.

## Features

- 100+ medical and nursing calculations
- Unit conversions (length, weight, temperature, pressure, area, volume, energy, infusion, concentration)
- Modern, intuitive mobile interface
- Search and filter calculations by category
- AI-powered explanations for calculation results
- Optimized for iOS and Android devices
- Semi-offline-capable calculations

## Try the Web Version

The original CLINICALC web application is available at:
**https://clinicalc.onrender.com**

## Get the Mobile App

The mobile app is currently pending publication on the **Play Store** and **App Store**.

In the meantime:

- **Contact us** to get early access to the app (see contact information below)
- **Or install and try it yourself** using the instructions below

## Get Started (Development)

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the app**

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:

- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Contributing

**Want to add new medical calculations?**

All calculation contributions should be made to the **[CLINICALC Web App Repository](https://github.com/niol08/CLINICALC)**

To contribute:

1. Visit and clone the web app repository
2. Follow the contribution guidelines there to add your calculation
3. Submit your Pull Request to the web app repo
4. Once merged, your calculation will be integrated into this mobile app in real time.

This approach ensures consistency across both platforms and allows the calculation engine to be maintained in one place.
